*) Elastic Block Storage (EBS):
    -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html

    *) Storage area network:
        -> './images/02_Storage_Area_Network.jpg'
        -> you can share the disk(storage) over the network using Storage area network.
        -> If you want to use some storage from the cloud to the client machine in that case we will just mount that storage and we can use it. and it will happen over the network.
        -> So, The disk that we create over the network which is called as EBS in aws.

    -> So every time we will create the instance we will attach the EBS volume to that instance.
        -> https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#Volumes:
    -> And this volume that get attached is through the network and it is called as EBS on aws.
    -> Because EBS happen over the network because of the we have face small latency somewhere around in ms.
    -> Also we can attach Multiple EBS on the same instance.
    -> And if you delete the instance on you choice you can only delete the instance and Volume will not get deleted and you can use that volume to access history of data that you have stored.
    -> There are multiple types of EBS volume where some single volume can get attach to multiple instances and some single volume can only be able to attach to one instance.
    -> Whenever we create the EBS volume it will get created on Availability zone so we can only attach those instance which are under the same Availability zone. But you can be able to access different Availability zone EBS volume to different Availability zone instance using Snapshot.
    -> You can Increase EBS volume size as well on running EBS.
