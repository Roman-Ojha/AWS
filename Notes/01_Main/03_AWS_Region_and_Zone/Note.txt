*) Regions & Availability Zone:
	-> https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/
	*) Regions:
		-> In one region there could be multiple Availability zone.
		-> EX: India, Us
		-> Every region have it's own Code name: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html
		-> In some case in one region there might not have all the AWS service available, AWS handle it by it's self if you want the service and that does't exist on your availability zone.
		-> Region required because of latency time to access service, or Government Policy that data should only exist on the given country, Cost Benefits
	*) Availability Zone:
		-> Actual infrastructure, Data Center & Server
		-> 1 Availability Zone could have multiple Data center.
		-> Every availability zone is at least minimum 60-100 Km in distance
		-> Region code like: ap-south-1
		-> Availability zone code: <region_code>a, <region_code>b
		-> Data transfer from one availability zone to another one is in high speed and are encrypted.

	
	*) Best Practice:
		-> We will not put our user data only in one region & Availability zone because if on that zone some disaster happen in that case all the data center will get lost and you will no longer be able to get user data.
		-> So, we store main data into one availability zone but we will add a replica of that daa into another Region as well.


*) Local Zone:
	-> https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/?nc=sn&loc=1
	-> https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/locations/
	-> If you are using Dehli local zone then accessing service by using from dehli will get in single digit(<10ms) latency.
