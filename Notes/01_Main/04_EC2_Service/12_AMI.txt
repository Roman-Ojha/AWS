*) AWS AMI:
	-> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html
	-> We can create the template of our own OS image where we can add ex: nginx, docker by default and we can reuse that image multiple times while creating new instance.
	-> where on that custome image that we have created whenever we will use to create new instance it alread have downloaded application like: 'nxinx', 'docker' inside and no need a time to install it again.
	*) Demo:
		*) Create own image:
			-> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html#creating-an-ami
			-> We will create new Instance.
			-> afer that we will instan nginx:
				-> sudo apt update
				-> sudo apt install nginx -y
			-> after that we will create AMI of that image.
			*) One method:
				-> Do "Actions" on actions we can find "Images and templates" click and then Create Image
			*) Second method:
				-> we have added the EBS volume on the instance to store OS so we will going to create the snapshot of that volume
				-> after that we will go to "Actions" and Create image from snapshot
			-> After creating AMI we will go under 'AMIs' tab: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#Images:visibility=owned-by-me
			-> Now we can create instance from AMI we can do that from "AMIs" page as well or we can do it while create new instance page.

		*) Share AMIs:
			-> For that you have to do Edit AMIs permissions
			-> Where you can share or make it public

		*) Copy AMI:
			-> you can copy AMI to other multiple region so that we can create instance on that region as well.

		*) Delete AMI:
			-> first we have to de-register from AMI page after that we have to delete the snapshot that had been create for AMIs.
