	-> Let's take an example where you project that on you server there will be 1000 request per second, but in reality there were 1 mil request per second
	-> Or you project that on you server there will be 1 mil request per second but there were only 1000 request per second 
	-> In first case you need more server but in case of second case you need less server.
	-> Using Auto scaling it will automatically handle these scaling of server.
	*) Different types of Scaling:
		1. Vertical Scaling:
			-> Scaling of the Server like CPU, RAM
		2. Horizontal Scaling:
			-> Scaling of the Number of Server

	*) Demo:
		-> First we will create launch template: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#LaunchTemplates:
			-> Where we will create the instance template so that we can use it for later for auto scaling
			-> And we will put bellow user data:
				#!/bin/bash
				apt-get update
				apt-get install nginx -y
				service nginx start
				echo "this is $(hostname)" > /var/www/html/index.html

				-> (NOTE that on production application you will write shell script that will automatically run you application)

		-> Now we will create auto Scaling: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#CreateAutoScalingGroup:
		-> Where we will select launch template that we create before.
		-> We will provide the give setting that we want and we will not enable load balancer for now in this example.
		-> You can now provide minimum, maximum capacity of instance that you want and then it will 
		automatically handle creating and deleting instance according to the traffic. for now we will provide:
			-> minimum: 1
			-> maximum: 10
		-> Now it will automatically create and adjust the amount of instance that is required.

		-> NOTE: on the production application we will actually use Auto scaling rather then creating new instance as per traffic.
