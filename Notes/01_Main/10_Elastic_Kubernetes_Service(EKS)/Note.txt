*) EKS:
    -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/?icmpid=docs_homepage_containers
    -> EKS is managed Kubernetes Service
    -> AWS is responsible for managing control plane of your k8s cluster
    -> Provisioning/Maintaining master nodes for you.
    -> Install Necessary Control plane processes, API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd.
    -> AWS Make it easy to Scale up and backup you cluster
    -> The only thing that we have to worry about is Worker nodes.
    

*) Steps to Setup Cluster
    1) Creating EKS Cluster:
        -> './07_Creating_EKS_Cluster.png'
    2) Creating Worker Nodes:
        -> After creating your EKS cluster you have to work with Worker nodes.
        -> To create Node Group we need
            -> To Create A Node Group.
                -> Node Group is a group of Nodes which you will going to use as a Worker Nodes with in your k8s environment.
            -> To select instance type
            -> Define min/max number of nodes in your node group
            -> Specify which EKS cluster to connect to you Worker Nodes
    3) Connect to our Cluster from our Local machine:
        -> To connect to the EKS cluster:
            -> we will get the connection information from EKS cluster
            -> run 'kubectl config set-cluster' and pass the information that we have to connect to the cluster
    
*) Different Ways to Create Cluster
    1. AWS UI Console Environment
        -> More harder way to create a cluster
    2. Eksctl:
        -> it is a tool that will help us to create the Cluster
        -> like you can create a cluster with just single command like: 'eksctl create cluster'
    3. IAC(Infrastructure as Code):
        -> Like: Terraform/Pulumi
