*) Instance Storage:
    -> If you don't want to use EBS and don't want to pass data through network because it will have some latency in that case you can use Instance Storage where That storage hardware will be attached to the Instance which is using that storage
    -> But whenever we will terminate the instance all the data will also get lost because that storage will also get terminated.
    -> You can go here to see all the images that have Instance Storage Attached: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#Images:visibility=public-images;rootDeviceType=instance-store;search=:ubuntu;v=3;$case=tags:false%5C,client:false;$regex=tags:false%5C,client:false
    -> We can use Instance Storage to access data with low latency and can store temporary data.

    -> NOTE that if aws is upgrading the infrastructure or physical server where you instance is running in that case it will stop you instance temporarily and all the Instance Storage that is attached with the instance will get deleted but aws will notify you before they will doing that action.
