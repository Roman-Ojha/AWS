*) Elastic Block Storage (EBS):
    -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html

    *) Storage area network:
        -> './images/02_Storage_Area_Network.jpg'
        -> you can share the disk(storage) over the network using Storage area network.
        -> If you want to use some storage from the cloud to the client machine in that case we will just mount that storage and we can use it. and it will happen over the network.
        -> So, The disk that we create over the network which is called as EBS in aws.

    -> So every time we will create the instance we will attach the EBS volume to that instance.
        -> https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#Volumes:
    -> And this volume that get attached is through the network and it is called as EBS on aws.
    -> Because EBS happen over the network because of the we have face small latency somewhere around in ms.
    -> Also we can attach Multiple EBS on the same instance.
    -> And if you delete the instance on you choice you can only delete the instance and Volume will not get deleted and you can use that volume to access history of data that you have stored.
    -> There are multiple types of EBS volume where some single volume can get attach to multiple instances and some single volume can only be able to attach to one instance.
    -> Whenever we create the EBS volume it will get created on Availability zone so we can only attach those instance which are under the same Availability zone. But you can be able to access different Availability zone EBS volume to different Availability zone instance using Snapshot.
    -> You can Increase EBS volume size as well on running EBS.
    *) Different types of EBS volumes:
        1. io1, io2:
            -> this volume can get attach to multiple instances.
    
    -> We use EBS for data persistent.

    -> Whenever we will create the EBS volume aws will by default create the same replica on same Availability zone. so, if by mistake the original EBS volume get deleted on that case also aws will provide the EBS volume.

*) Instance Storage:
    -> If you don't want to use EBS and don't want to pass data through network because it will have some latency in that case you can use Instance Storage where That storage hardware will be attached to the Instance which is using that storage
    -> But whenever we will terminate the instance all the data will also get lost because that storage will also get terminated.
    -> You can go here to see all the images that have Instance Storage Attached: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#Images:visibility=public-images;rootDeviceType=instance-store;search=:ubuntu;v=3;$case=tags:false%5C,client:false;$regex=tags:false%5C,client:false
    -> We can use Instance Storage to access data with low latency and can store temporary data.

    -> NOTE that if aws is upgrading the infrastructure or physical server where you instance is running in that case it will stop you instance temporarily and all the Instance Storage that is attached with the instance will get deleted but aws will notify you before they will doing that action.
